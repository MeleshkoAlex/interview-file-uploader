# Adim Full Stack Takehome

Hi! Welcome to the take home. Here is a bare bones next.js app created with the t3 app! The bottom of this readme contains some usage tips if you are new to t3 -- essentially it sets up a bit of boilerplate so you can get moving faster.

## Task

Using the [giphy.com API](https://developers.giphy.com/), create an app that accomplishes the following:

1. User can search for a gif
2. User can select a gif from search results
3. Clicking submit will save the gif as a users PFP

- How to save the pfp image is up to you. One option is to upload to an Adim internal s3 bucket. The access keys will be provided along with this prompt.
